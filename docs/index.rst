Introduction
------------

The ``tk_tools`` package exists in a space like other packages.  In many cases, the ``tkinter`` interface leaves some API to be desired while, in other cases, it leaves out some room for fairly standard visualizations.  This is a collection of tools that have been developed over the course of creating GUI elements as a means to simplify and enhance the process and results.
