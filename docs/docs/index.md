# Purpose

The `tk_tools` package is a collection of useful widgets that simply
make working with tkinter more convenient.  I use these widgets and
simply decided to open-source them.

# Installation

## Dependencies

The tk_tools package is written with Python 3.5+ in mind!  It uses
type hints so that your IDE - such as PyCharm - can easily identify
potential issues with your code as you write it.  If you want this
to support a different python version, create an issue and I'm sure that
we can work something out easily enough.

## Direct Installation

Clone the [git repository](https://github.com/slightlynybbled/tk_tools),
navigate to the cloned directory, and `python3 setup.py install`.

## Using Pip

Simply `pip3 install tk_tools` to get the latest release.

# Using the Widgets

For a quick reference, there are examples of many of the widgets in the
[examples directory](https://github.com/slightlynybbled/tk_tools/tree/master/examples)
of the repository.  Check it out!  More complete documentation may
be found on the [widgets](widgets.md) page.
