# Purpose

This repository is intended to hold some of the most useful, higher-level widgets
that are native to tkinter.  This library is currently compatible with Python 3.5+ (uses
type hints), but could easily be back-ported to earlier versions if desired.

For more details, check out the [documentation](https://tk-tools.readthedocs.io).

# Contributions

I am always looking for new widgets!
